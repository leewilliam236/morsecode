# morsecode
Welcome to my very first project developed in C++ by leewilliam236!

I've currently developed the following functions.
- print (type in a few words or sentences and the computer will translate them by typing in the dots and dashes. It includes a generic beep sound too!)
- display (does the same as the print function, except the computer just displays the morse code.)

I'm still working on these functions.
- adjusting the speed (user can set it)
- adjusting the pitch (user can set it)
- typing in certain buttons to do certain commands during runtime
- telegraph mode

As you can see, the project is currently under construction. I might add more to the list of what I'm working on, but I'm currently showing this project simply for feedback!

NOTE: The beeps and sleep function only work on Windows!
